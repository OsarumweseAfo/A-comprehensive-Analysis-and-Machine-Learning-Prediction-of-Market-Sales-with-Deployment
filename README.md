# Project Overview

Title: 
A comprehensive Analysis and Machine Learning Analysis Prediction of Market Sales with Deployment.

Objective:
In the world of business today, accurate forcasting of sales is very important to fully maximising prining startegies, inventory and the overall performance of a business. This project aims to analyze market sales trend and develop machine learning predictive model that can estimate future sales based on unit pricing, quantity, cutomer type and product line.

Scope:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

* Handling missing values, removing duplicates, ensure correct data types,creating our target variable and encoding categorical variables.
* Visaulize trends and relationship among variables to have a clear picture of the data set and understand factors influencing market sales
* Build and compare multiple regression models(e.g Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Elalstic net, Decesion Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and Random Tree Regressor) to predict market sales.
* Create an interactive web application using streamlit to deploy the best performing model, allowing users to input features values and obtain market  sales predictions.
